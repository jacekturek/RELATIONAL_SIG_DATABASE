Databases (realtional) are designed hierarchically.
Here I outline TABLES, RELATIONS, ...
Descriptuon is based on attributes, operators of relational language.
##
>Tables: table signal is <name, where> / types of data are acoordingly

signal <name, where> <br>
who <where, name_like> <br>
frequency <signal_name, where, rate_0_100>

tables connection: 
<br>
***on key WHERE signal and who*** <br>
***on key NAME signal and frequency***

<br>
These relations are build consistently in order to gain information.
