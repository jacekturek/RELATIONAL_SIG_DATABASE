# Relations in database

Since the database is about signals in the tables with signals the signal name is a 

* candidate key
* signal name in SEO is a ranking (as well)

The key is not UNIQUE, but it is possible to make

* unique compound keys
* (signal name, "where") in several tables

This is how it works in a table:

Similarly in other tables like:

* signals_perc, which show how much of the signal is in my page (in social media)
* the same unique compound key can be set

# Relation (foreign key)

> With that I can combine the two tables with a relation based on these keys.

# Other relations

In such a table 'PAGE' should be UNIQUE:
